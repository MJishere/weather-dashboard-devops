# Weather-Dashboard-DevOps

This project was built as a DevOps portfolio project to demonstrate my ability to design, automate, and deploy a full-stack application using modern DevOps tools and cloud infrastructure.

It showcases the entire DevOps lifecycle â€” from infrastructure provisioning with Terraform, to CI/CD automation using Jenkins, to containerized deployment on AWS EKS (Kubernetes).

Although the app itself is a simple Weather Dashboard (React + Node.js), the real focus of this project is the DevOps architecture that supports it.

# Architecture Summary

Bootstrap Phase:

    1. jenkins-bootstraph/

    2. Uses Terraform to create an EC2 instance and configure jenkins in Docker

    3. Setup S3(for terraform state) and DynamoDB(for state locking)
    
    4. Installs essentials tools in the jenkins container via user data:
        Docker CLI, AWS CLI, Terraform, Kubectl, Git, Curl, Wget, Unzip 


Infrastructure Phase:

    1. Provision AWS resources for the application using Terraform run by jenkins
        * EKS cluster for Kubernetes
        * ECR Repositories for container images
        * VPC resources
    
CI/CD Phase( Jenkinsfile + Jenkinsfiles/)
    
    1. Jenkinsfiles/Jenkinsfile.infra : Pipeline script to create AWS resources 
       for the application using Terraform run by jenkins

    2. Jenkinsfile:
        * Fetch application code from SCM(Github)
        * Build Docker images for frontend and backend, pushes to ECR
        * Deploy the images to Kubernetes cluster

    3. Jenkinsfiles/Jenkinsfile.infra-destroy: Destroy infrastructure cleanly if needed

## Deployment

Prerequisites:

    1. AWS Account
    2. Openweather API key
    3. Terraform Installed locally

Project Flow:

    1. Run Jenkins Bootstraph Terraform locally

        * An Ec2 instance with Jenkins server and necessary tools required running
        * Remote backend for Terraform

    2. Create and Run Infra Pipeline (Jenkinsfiles/Jenkinsfile.infra)

        * Provision AWS infra ( IAM, ECR, EKS, VPC)

    3. Run Application Pipeline (Jenkinsfile)

        * Fetch Source code from github repo
        * Build Docker images and Push to ECR
        * Deploy to EKS
    
    4. Access Application

        * User Frontend Service Loadbalancer DNS to access the Application
        * The React frontend connects to the Node.js backend via LoadBalancer 
        service on EKS
        




## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to the jenkins credentials

`aws-devops-creds` AWS Credentials, also requires AWS credentials Plugin to be installed in the Jenkins server

`OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` Openweather API key -> https://openweathermap.org/api
