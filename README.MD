This project was designed and implemented as a DevOps portfolio project to demonstrate my ability to build, automate, and deploy a full-stack application using modern DevOps practices.
It showcases the complete lifecycle â€” from infrastructure provisioning to CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and Kubernetes deployment on AWS.

The application itself is a simple Weather Dashboard, but the real focus of this project is the DevOps architecture that supports it.
